# express-blog-api
We are building a blog website with an API using Express.js. Users can view, create, edit, and delete blog posts. We will set up Node.js, configure Express.js, and create a database. We will define API routes and functions to handle CRUD operations on blog posts. We will create the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and use AJAX to communicate with the API. We will ensure our code is secure and handles errors properly. This project provides hands-on experience building a full-stack web application.
